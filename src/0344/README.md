# 0344. [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/?envType=study-plan&id=algorithm-i)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### **Example 1:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

### **Example 2:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
</pre>

### **Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.
