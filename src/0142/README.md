# 0142. [Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.**

**Do not modify** the linked list.

### **Example 1:**

![](./circularlinkedlist.png)

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> tail connects to node index 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
</pre>

### **Example 2:**

![](./circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2], pos = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> tail connects to node index 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
</pre>

### **Example 3:**

![](./circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1], pos = -1
<strong>Output:</strong> no cycle
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no cycle in the linked list.
</pre>

### **Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
