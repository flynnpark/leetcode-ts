# 0409. [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/?envType=study-plan&id=level-1)

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

### **Example 1:\***

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "abccccdd"
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
</pre>

### **Example 2:\***

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "a"
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
</pre>

### **Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.
